# Password Search PowerToys Command Palette Extension

An extension for the PowerToys Command Palette that lets you quickly search, generate, and open KeePass entries.

## Features

* **Configure KeePass DB**: set your database path and master password via a settings page.
* **Search KeePass**: perform a case-insensitive title search in your KeePass vault and copy passwords or usernames to the clipboard.
* **Context-menu Actions**: in addition to copying, open entries directly in the KeePass application or launch associated URLs in your browser.
* **Generate Password**: choose a custom length at runtime (e.g., type `16` for a 16-character password or pick from default suggestions) to generate a cryptographically secure password and copy it to the clipboard.

* Windows 10 or higher
* PowerToys installed (v0.##+)
